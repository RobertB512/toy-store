# Toy Store

This is a toy store site using React and create-react-app. NOTE: this is NOT a real site. You are NOT able to actually buy products on this site. This is just a pretend site to preactice my React skills.

The toys are generated from a list I created in json format. There is no backend or API I get the toys from. It would've been nice to find a good API, but I didn't find much out there, except for maybe one, but I didn't want to pay it's fee.
